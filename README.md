# Noita-Speed-Calculator
Finds Combinations of modifiers to use for Speed Based Long Distance Travel.

### Sparse Vector Solution Finder CLI

This command-line tool computes sparse integer vectors that, when used as exponents with provided coefficients, approximate a target distance after applying a scaling factor. It aims to minimize sparsity, total sum of exponents, and approximation error.

## Usage

```bash
python your_script.py DISTANCE [OPTIONS]
```

### Positional Argument

* `DISTANCE` (float):
  The target distance you want to approximate.

### Optional Arguments

* `--coefs`, `-c` (float list):
  List of multiplicative coefficients to use as bases. Defaults to:

  ```
  1.2 0.3 0.32 0.33 0.75 1.68 2.0 2.5 7.5
  ```

* `--tol`, `-t` (float):
  Relative tolerance allowed for approximation error. Default is `0.005` (i.e., 0.5%).

* `--top-n`, `-n` (int):
  Number of top solutions to return. Default is `25`.

* `--max-exp`, `-M` (int):
  Maximum exponent allowed for capped coefficients. Default is `41`.

* `--uncapped`, `-u` (int list):
  Indices of coefficients that are uncapped (can have arbitrarily large exponents within practical bounds). The base speed coefficient at index `0` is always considered uncapped.

* `--sort` (str):
  Comma-separated priority keys to sort solutions. Available keys:

  * `nz`: number of non-zero exponents (sparsity)
  * `sum`: sum of all exponents except `x0`
  * `x0`: exponent for the first coefficient
  * `rel`: relative error
  * `abs`: absolute error

  Default sort order: `nz,sum,x0,rel`

## Output Format

For each solution, the following are printed:

```
<labels>   |  distance | abs_err | rel_err |
```

* `<labels>`: Coefficient labels or values
* `distance`: Estimated distance from the current solution
* `abs_err`: Absolute error between estimated and target distance
* `rel_err`: Relative error (scientific notation)

## Example

```bash
python your_script.py 120.0 -c 1.2 0.5 2.0 --top-n 5 --tol 0.01 --uncapped 0 --sort nz,sum,rel
```

## Notes

* The `BASE_SPEED` is fixed at `7.92` and used to convert the product of powers into an estimated distance.
* The tool uses a meet-in-the-middle strategy for efficient computation.

## Notes

* Index 0 (the first coefficient) is always uncapped.
* All bases must be positive; any base ≤ 1 is treated as uncapped (error if ≤ 0).
* Increasing/lowering `--top-n` can find more/fewer solutions (impacts runtime).
